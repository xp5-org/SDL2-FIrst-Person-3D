this is my SDL2 OpenGL 1st-person view demo. You are welcome to clone it and re-use the code as you see fit.

If you have any questions about this repl or need help getting started with OpenGL/SDL/GLFW/GLUT send me a message on replit i will take a look

demonstrates:
- OpenGL calls for cube and plane
- SDL2 for window & ontext creation
- vertices and face culling (broken and commented out)
- keyboard and mouse input 

whats missing/TODO: 
- needs some work around CPU and need to set framerate
- audio not set up
